This program contains four types of cell: Mycoplasma, Evolver, Predator and Prey.
It covers all base tasks (to some extent) as well as the Symbiosis challenge task.

Predator and prey are to be run in tangent, and should both be called in the populate() method when testing their simulation.

The Simulator class can simply be updated with additional methods to simulate more lifeforms.
